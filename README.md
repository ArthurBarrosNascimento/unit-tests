# Project Unit Tests ðŸ”§

<p>In this project, a form was developed using the knowledge learned so far. It was a great experience to work on this project because I could play with CSS and learn about form tags and some concepts of data capture.</p>

<p>The project was carried out during the FullStack Programming course at Trybe, using knowledge of JavaScript.</p>
